# Loading the Rfacebook package
library(Rfacebook)

## To get access to the Facebook API, you need an OAuth code.
## You can get yours going to the following URL:

## https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer

## Once you're there:
## 1) Click on "Get Access Token"
## 2) Copy the long code ("Access Token") and paste it here below, substituting
## the fake one I wrote:

fb_oauth = 'XXXXXXX'

## Now try running the following line:
getUsers("me", token=fb_oauth, private_info=TRUE)

## Does it return your Facebook public information? Yes? Then we're ready to go

## See also ?fbOAuth for information on how to get a long-lived OAuth token

### SCRAPING INFORMATION FROM FACEBOOK PAGES ###
################################################

# How can I get a list of posts from a Facebook page?
# The following line downloads the ~100 most recent posts on the facebook
# page of Barack Obama
page <- getPage("barackobama", token=fb_oauth, n=100) 

# What information is available for each of these posts?
page[1,]

# Which post got more likes?
page[which.max(page$likes_count),]

# Which post got more comments?
page[which.max(page$comments_count),]

# Which post was shared the most?
page[which.max(page$shares_count),]

# We can also subset by date
# For example, imagine we want to get all the posts from October 2012
page <- getPage("barackobama", token=fb_oauth, n=1000,
	since='2012/10/01', until='2012/10/30')

### COLLECTING PAGES' LIKES DATA ###
####################################

# How can I get a list of users who liked a specific post?
# The following line downloads more information about the first post
# (note that it uses the ID of the post as main option), as well
# as a list of 1,000 people who "liked" it
post <- getPost(page$id[1], token=fb_oauth, n.likes=1000, comments=FALSE)

# This is how you can view that list of people:
likes <- post$likes
head(likes)

# What information is available for these users?
# The first step is to use again "getUsers" to gather their public Facebook
# information, with their IDs as main option.
users <- getUsers(likes$from_id, token=fb_oauth)

# What are the most common first names?
head(sort(table(users$first_name), decreasing=TRUE), n=10)

# This gives us an idea about the gender distribution of the people 
# interacting with this page.

##################################
### COLLECTING PAGES' COMMENTS ###
##################################

# How can I get the text of the comments on a specific post?
post <- getPost(post$id[1], token=fb_oauth, n.comments=1000, likes=FALSE)

# This is how you can view those comments:
comments <- post$comments
head(comments)

# Also, note that users can like comments!
# What is the comment that got the most likes?
comments[which.max(comments$likes_count),]

### searchPages function

posts <- searchPages("Charlotte", token = fb_oauth , n = 200)
